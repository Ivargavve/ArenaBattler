# AutoBattler (Working Title)

**AutoBattler** is a hardcore, text-based autobattler RPG. Players control one character at a time â€” when they die, they're gone for good. The user's account persists across playthroughs and accumulates legacy progress like XP, cosmetics, and achievements.

## Core Features

- Text-based turn-based battles (PvE & PvP)
- Hardcore permadeath system
- Character creation & progression
- Daily energy & health management
- Gear & stat-based combat outcomes
- Dungeons, raids, and limited-time events
- In-game currency, shop, and cosmetics
- Social features: friends, top players, graveyard history

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Angular 18 (Netlify)
- **Backend:** .NET 8 API (Render)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Render or Supabase)
- **Authentication:** Google Sign-In (OAuth)
- **Design:** Arcane-inspired, stylized cartoon aesthetic

## Planned Pages

- Home (patch notes, character summary)
- Battle (bots, friends, dungeons, raids)
- Armory (gear, stats, leveling)
- Shop (gear, consumables, cosmetics)
- Social (friends, leaderboards, profiles)
- Graveyard (dead characters + stats)
- Achievements
- Character creation (on first login or after death)
- Inbox / notifications
- World lore (background story & dungeon info)

## Combat Example (Text-Based)

```
The battle begins.
Your character strikes Player 2 for 4 damage with Iron Dagger.
Player 2 counterattacks and deals 2 damage.
Victory! You win 5 silver coins and gain +17 XP (+2 User XP).
```

## Future Plans

- Procedural daily events (moon cycles, special raids)
- Cosmetic-only store linked to persistent User account
- Deep social integration and achievements
- Full legacy system and stat tracking
